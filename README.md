<h1>Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h1>

Hello! My name is Laura. I recently completed a coding boot camp where I spent time learning skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Python, and React. I enjoyed the fast-paced learning environment and the opportunity to spend time creating content that interests me. 

Prior to this career change, I was a mathematics publisher for Oxford University Press in Australia. I was responsible for growing the maths portfolio of Oxford ANZ which included proposing new ideas to the business, backed by data and research. I successfully introduced 5 books to the market in 2 years. I developed skills involving the layout and design of the books during my time there.

My formal training is in Pure Mathematics, and although publishing had its challenges, my love of math drew me to a career in coding due to the more logical problem-solving aspects. I also am excited to transfer my design skills to this new medium.
