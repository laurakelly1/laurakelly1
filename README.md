<h1>Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h1>

Hello! My name is Laura. I recently completed a coding boot camp where I spent time learning skills necessary for software engineering. I enjoyed the fast-paced learning environment and the opportunity to spend time creating content that interests me. 

My formal training is in Pure Mathematics, and prior to this career change I was a mathematics publisher. My love of math drew me to a career in coding due to the more logical problem-solving aspects. I also am excited to transfer my design skills to this new medium.
